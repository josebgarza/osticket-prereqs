First, start by creating a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure with at minimum, 2 vcpus and 8 GiB memory. The username and password can be anything you'd like, just make sure to take note of it.
</p>

Copy the public IP address of your VM and go to the Windows app. From there, you will add a new PC, paste the IP address, and then you can name it "osTicket". After adding the VM, log into it using the username and password you created.
</p>

Next, we must install/enable IIS in Windows with CGI. Go to your search bar > Type "Control Panel" > Click "Programs" > "Turn Windows features on or off" > Scroll down to "Internet Information Services" (IIS) and click on it to enable > Expand it by clicking the "+" next to IIS > Expand "World Wide Web Services" > Expand "Application Development Features" > Click the box next to "CGI" and press "ok".
</p>
<br />

Now that we have the ISS applied, we will begin installing the PHP manager file. The PHP manager is the programming lanuguage that will allow us to run the osTicket software to run off a web browser. To download, run the PHP program from the files found at the beginning of this demonstration. Agree to all the terms and it will now be in the operating system.

Next, find the Rewrite Module (rewrite_amd64_en-US.msi), from the "Download Now" link. Agree to all the terms and install.

Now, we'll create the directory C:\PHP. To do this, open File Explorer > type "C:\" in the search bar > Right-click and create a new folder called, "PHP". Download php-7.3.8-nts-Win32-VC15-x86.zip from the "Download Now" link > Extract it by going to where you download the file, Right-click the PHP 7.3.8 file and press "extract all" and browse to the PHP Folder you just created to dump the files in there.

Launch the MySQL > Click "standard configuration" and next > create the username and password. Make sure to keep note of them.

Go to the search bar > Type "IIS" > Right-click to run as admin. From here we will do the pre-install process for osTicket.
</p>
<br />

![Screen Shot 2024-12-27 at 6 40 20 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe6d7076-e462-4ac9-a66f-2fa16fe8a0de)

Go to PHP Manager > click "Register new PHP version" > browse to the Windows (C:) drive > open the PHP folder > open the "php-cgi" application and press ok.
</p>
<br />

![Screen Shot 2024-12-27 at 6 46 22 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ef48157-8435-422f-acd3-2537a93d6ad6)

Refresh IIS by clicking stop, wait a few seconds, and then click start.
</p>
<br />

![Screen Shot 2024-12-27 at 6 51 07 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58e36e57-7e02-48b8-959c-8b3542d63d8f)

Now to start installing osTicket, open a seperate File Exploxer tab > extract the "osTicket-v1.15.8" files > Open Windows (C:) > Click on "inetpub" > Open "wwwroot" > Copy "upload" from the extracted files to "wwwroot" > Within ‚Äúc:\inetpub\wwwroot‚Äù, Rename ‚Äúupload‚Äù to "osTicket". 
</p>
<br />

![Screen Shot 2024-12-27 at 7 02 37 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/255b8b80-8b24-4395-b78a-1c71fbd70735)

Here, you can see that "osTicket" is now within the "wwwroot" folder.
</p>
<br />

![Screen Shot 2024-12-27 at 7 05 41 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee21f950-dfde-4df4-a610-217797750277)

Go back to the IIS, and stop then start the server to refresh like we did previously.
</p>
<br />

![Screen Shot 2024-12-27 at 7 12 21 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1f3bddb-cf18-4ec0-a5cf-631ece5269fb)

In IIS, go to Sites > Default Web Site > osTicket > In the right corner, click "Browse *.80 (http)". Here it will load the osTicket site.
</p>
<br />

![Screen Shot 2024-12-27 at 7 25 16 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b02fb9ba-5fbb-4e2f-a288-0ac9e837c267)

Since some of the extensions necessary to run osTicket correctly are not enabled, go back to IIS > Sites > Default Web Site > osTicket > Double-click on the PHP Manager > Click on "Enable or disable an extension" > Enable the following - "php_imap.dll", "php_intl.dll", "php_opcache.dll" > Refresh the browser on osTicket.

</p>
<br />

We'll now rename a file. Go From: "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-sampleconfig.php" To: "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-config.php"
</p>
<br />

![Screen Shot 2024-12-27 at 7 44 43 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1176e97-ae11-4fd8-989a-1e1d5b3c24d9)

Now we must assign permissions to the renamed file. Right-click "ost-config.php" > Properties > Security > Advanced > Disable inheritence > Remove all inherited permissions from this object > Add > Select Principal > Type "everyone" > Press ok > Check "Full Control" and apply the changes.
</p>
<br />

We'll now finish the setup in the browser. Enter a name for the Help Desk and an email.
</p>

Install HeidiSQL from the downloaded files found in osTicket on the Desktop
</p>
<br />

In HeidiSQL, start a new session and have the user and password be "root" for both and then connect to the session.
</p>

Create a new database called "osTicket"
</p>

Finally, we'll clean up some of the files. Delete: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\setup.
